          <p>The story is set in a world where Devils are born from human fears. Devils are usually dangerous and malevolent, their power proportional to the fear they incite. However, humans can form contracts with them to use their power, and there are individuals specializing in hunting and employing them, called Devil Hunters. Devils originate from Hell, and exist in a cycle between Earth and Hell: they migrate to Earth when killed in Hell, and vice-versa. Dwelling in Hell are extremely powerful Devils called Primal Fears, which have never been killed. Transit between planes appears to be overseen by the Hell Devil. </p>

          <p>A Devil may, in certain conditions, inhabit the body of a dead human, gaining some of their memories and personality; such a creature is called a Fiend. Devils who naturally have a humanoid form are said to be benevolent to humans. </p>
          <p>The events of the story take place in 1997, in an alternate timeline where the Soviet Union still exists, and many events such as the Holocaust are revealed to have been erased from history. Nuclear weapons once existed in this world, but due to consumption of the Nuclear Weapons Devil by the Chainsaw Devil, they have ceased to exist entirely.</p>

          <p>Denji is a young man trapped in poverty, working off his deceased father's debt to the yakuza by working as a Devil Hunter, aided by Pochita, his canine companion and Chainsaw Devil. Denji is betrayed by the yakuza, who kill him for a contract with the Zombie Devil. Pochita makes a contract with Denji, merging with him as a human-devil Hybrid, under the condition that Denji shows his dreams to Pochita. Denji massacres the yakuza, and is approached by a team of governmental Devil Hunters, the Public Safety Division, led by Makima, who persuades him to join their ranks. Agreeing, Denji is partnered with Power, the Blood Fiend, and Aki Hayakawa, a self-destructive Devil Hunter. Makima promises Denji any favor, provided he kill the Gun Devil, perpetrator of the greatest massacre in human history. </p>

          <p>Denji's group encounters another hybrid, the Katana Man, a vengeful yakuza seemingly allied with the Gun Devil, who kills a great portion of the Division. Denji and Power are trained by Kishibe, a master Devil-hunter who distrusts Makima; Aki makes a deal with the Future Devil, who foresees a "horrible death" for him. The Division launches a counter-attack against the Katana Man, capturing him. </p>

          <p>Some time later, Denji begins a romance with a woman named Reze, who is actually the Bomb Woman, a Hybrid spy for the Soviet Union, sent to capture him. Though returning his affection, she attacks the city, with the Division barely saving Denji. After recovering, Denji fights her, and accepts a proposal to leave Japan together; before they can reunite, Makima secretly captures her. Denji's fight with the Bomb Woman reveals his existence to the world. </p>

          <p>Foreign assassin groups target Denji: Chinese hunter Quanxi; a mysterious enemy of Makima called "Santa Claus"; three American brothers; and a Russian woman teaching a pupil, Tolka. Denji is outfitted with a security detail. Though the brothers are repelled, and Quanxi initially stalls, Santa Claus uses their Doll Devil powers for a large horde attack. After a follow-up by Quanxi, Tolka's master reveals herself as the true "Santa Claus", and has all parties transported to Hell, where they are attacked by the Darkness Devil. Santa Claus makes a contract with the Darkness Devil that empowers her. Makima retrieves the group from Hell, and Quanxi helps Denji defeat Santa Claus; Makima dispatches her afterwards.</p>

          <p>After Denji recovers, Makima reveals the Gun Devil is actually a geopolitical asset, with many factions controlling pieces of it. As Aki begs Makima for Denji's safety, the president of the United States orders the Gun Devil to attack Japan and kill Makima. Revealed to be the Control Devil, Makima confronts the Gun Devil and wins. Aki dies in the attack, and the Gun Devil takes his body as a Fiend. Denji is attacked by the Gun Fiend, and, helped by civilians, kills it; Aki's death devastates him. While seemingly consoling him, Makima kills Power, revealing herself responsible for Denji's losses, having plotted to void his contract with Pochita by crushing his dreams of a normal life.</p>

          <p>Kishibe attacks her, and she calls for "Chainsaw Man" to save her. Controlling Denji's body, Pochita assumes his true form and runs. Makima explains her goals: to use Pochita's power to eliminate concepts from reality to create a world without suffering; to this end, she was empowered by the government with immortality. Fighting the Chainsaw Man using the brainwashed Hybrids, which include Katana Man, Reze, and Quanxi, she wins, as Denji's heroic deeds have weakened Pochita. However, Power revives as the Blood Devil from a remnant of her blood from Denji, escapes with Chainsaw Man, and, mortally wounded, restores Denji's will to live, having him promise to find her when she is reborn in Hell.</p>

          <p>Invigorated by public support for him, Denji confronts Makima and defeats her; to bypass her immortality, he eats her body. Kishibe reveals the Control Devil resurfaced in the form of a little girl, now named Nayuta. He asks Denji to look after her, and Pochita supports this mission in Denji's dreams. Later, Denji enrolls in high school and continues fighting devils under the public eye.</p>

          <ul>
            <li> <strong>Denji</strong> (デンジ) / <strong>Chainsaw Man</strong> (チェンソーマン, Chensō Man) </li>
            <p>A young man with scruffy blond hair, sharp yellowish-brown eyes with bags underneath, and sharp teeth. As a young boy, he inherits his father's debt from the yakuza upon his father's death. After meeting the Chainsaw Devil Pochita, he becomes a Devil Hunter in an attempt to clear his debt. The yakuza kill him, and Pochita becomes his heart, setting a contract with Denji, who is to live his dreams of a normal life. After this, he can transform into the devil-human hybrid known as Chainsaw Man by pulling the cord on his chest. After meeting Makima, he becomes a Public Safety Devil Hunter, to live in humane conditions, although the public sees him as a superhero for his heroic deeds. His initial primary motivation is his attraction to Makima. After Makima's death, his motivation shifts to using his newfound superhero fame as the Chainsaw Man to attract as many women as possible. Currently he enrolls in high school while taking care of Nayuta, Makima's reincarnation.</p>
            <li> <strong>Makima</strong> (マキマ) / <strong>Nayuta</strong> (ナユタ) </li>
            <p>A mysterious woman serving as the head of Public Safety Division 4, who takes Denji as her human pet. Makima is cunning, intelligent and manipulative, controlling Denji by taking advantage of his attraction to her with promises of a relationship, while threatening him with extermination in case of disobedience. For much of the story, her goals are unknown and her good intentions are ambiguous. She is later revealed to be the Control Devil, which embodies the fear of domination, and a member of the Four Horsemen Devils who seeks to use the Chainsaw Man, to whom she is enamored, to create a world without suffering. To this end, she masterminds the misfortunes befalling Denji over the series. After being killed by Denji, she is reborn as a child called Nayuta, and placed in his care, to be raised as a better person.</p>
            <li> <strong>Power</strong> (パワー, Pawā)</li>
            <p>The Blood Fiend and a Public Safety Devil Hunter in Makima's squad. Power looks like a young woman with long hair; as a Fiend, she has short red horns protruding from her head. Power loves violence and is childish, greedy, almost entirely self-motivated, and willing to harm others for her own satisfaction. Power loves her cat, Meowy, at one point willing to sacrifice Denji's life to save him. She comes to care deeply for Denji and Aki, her first true friends. She is killed by Makima in front of Denji, to break his spirit. Power revives as the Blood Devil from Denji's blood, but is fatally wounded by Makima again. Before dying, Power makes a contract with Denji - in exchange for her blood, Denji is to find the reborn Blood Devil and turn her back into Power, so they may be friends again.</p>
            <li> <strong>Aki Hayakawa</strong> (早川アキ, Hayakawa Aki)</li>
            <p>A Public Safety Devil Hunter working under Makima's squad. He has a contract with the Fox Devil and Curse Devil, allowing him to summon the former's head and use a lethal spike in exchange for his lifespan. He later makes a contract with the Future Devil, allowing him to see a few seconds into the future. Aki is stoic, mature and dependable, but has a soft center when alone. He grows to greatly care about Denji and Power, despite clashing with them. Desperate to save Denji and Power from the horrible future the Future Devil warned him about, he makes one last contract with Makima to counter the Gun Devil alongside Angel and the other deceased devil hunters, but is killed during the fight, and becomes the Gun Fiend, which Denji is forced to kill.</p>
            <li> <strong>Kishibe</strong> (岸辺)</li>
            <p>The strongest devil hunter in the organization. Older than most other hunters, he is scarred and cynical. He trains Denji and Power, and was partnered with Quanxi in his youth. He secretly plots against Makima.</p>
